        "explanation": "A comprehensive analysis of Hamlet should discuss the following themes:\n\n1. Revenge: Hamlet's quest to avenge his father's murder drives the plot, but Shakespeare complicates this theme by showing the psychological toll of revenge and questioning its moral validity.\n\n2. Madness: The play explores both real and feigned madness. Hamlet's 'antic disposition' raises questions about the nature of sanity and the thin line between performance and reality.\n\n3. Corruption and Decay: Images of disease, poison, and decay permeate the play, symbolizing the moral corruption in Denmark.\n\n4. Mortality and the Afterlife: Hamlet contemplates death and what may come after throughout the play, most famously in the 'To be or not to be' soliloquy.\n\n5. Action vs. Inaction: Hamlet's delay in taking revenge raises questions about the relationship between thought and action.\n\nStudents should provide specific examples from the text to support their analysis of these themes."

      "notes": "Expect students to cite specific scenes, soliloquies, and dialogue from the play. Higher marks should be awarded for original insights and close textual analysis."
